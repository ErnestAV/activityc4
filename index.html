		<h1>El Salvador's Top Lakes</h1>

		<p id='init_descript'>El Salvador is located in the Central American region. It is the smallest
			(even smaller than the state of Massachussetts), yet one of the prettiest countries
		when talking about natural touristic attractions. <br> It is rich in natural attractions
	 and has an awesome tropical weather all year long. Although there are many natural attractions
 		such as volcanos, waterfalls, and especially the beach... today, we will focus on the top lakes! <br><br>
		Without further ado, here are the top lakes of this awesome country: </p>

						<h3>El Salvador's largest crater volcano.</h3>

							beaches located on the banks of the lake. Diving is also available! <br> If you want a more extreme experience, you can
						dive to the active volcano crater and appreciate all the volcanic activity happening at the bottom of the lake.</p>
